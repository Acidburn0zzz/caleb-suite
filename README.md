CalebSuite
==========

A growing suite of IRC bots and utilites written in bash using the wonderfull [ii from suckless](http://tools.suckless.org/ii/).

Note: You can find examples of use in the lowercase files named `caleb.*`. They're for a guy's channel that these bots were made for; feel free to modify them for your own needs.

CalebBot
========

The leader of the group, CalebBot is a multi-facteted safe IRC bot that can stay up through updates with ease and be in multiple places at once (like a channel and his handy debugging REPL). Likes long hikes and juggling escape sequences.

CalebLnk
========

CalebBot's manager. He manages partnerships with other networks. (Needs work, such as the obvious /me displaying as ACTION.)
